# FHIR Validation

The Patient and Observation resources created in this project were validated
against FHIR R4 specifications.

Validation ensured:
- Mandatory elements are present
- Correct data types are used
- Observation resources correctly reference Patient resources
- No structural or semantic errors were detected

This step confirms that the translated legacy data complies with FHIR standards
and is safe for interoperability.
